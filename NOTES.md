  A cluster of hexayurts
    why ?
      sum of the parts are larger than the single parts
      synergy effect
      gives oppurtunity for community which gives opportunity for specialisation and delegation of responsibilities
        roles (farmer, black smith, tailor, teacher etc.)
          which ones are needed ?
          how many of each ?
          where in the cluster are they best placed ? (best use of resources)
    distribution of resources (space)
      how ?
        discus the following:
          line ?
          square grid ?
          hexagonal grid ?
          other ?
    infrastructure
      if spaced "close" together infrastructure may not be needed (everything within walking distance)
        pros and cons with this setup ?
      if spaced at "medium" range (within a few miles/kilometers)
        bicycles are sufficient as only means of infrastructure
      if spaced at "large" range (over 10-20 miles/kilometers apart)
        a vehicle (scooter/car/truck/bus) may be needed depending on the needs of the cluster / other clusters (neighbour communities)
          eg. daily transport from north cluster through all middle clusters to south cluster - back and forth every 4 hours ?
