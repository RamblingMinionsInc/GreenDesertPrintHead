(in a desert)

1. A single hexayurt
 1. construction
 * how ?
 * link to videoes

2. A cluster of hexayurts
    1. why ?
      * sum of the parts are larger than the single parts
      * synergy effect
      * gives oppurtunity for community which gives opportunity for specialisation and delegation of responsibilities
        * roles (farmer, black smith, tailor, teacher etc.)
          * which ones are needed ?
          * how many of each ?
          * where in the cluster are they best placed ? (best use of resources)
    2. distribution of resources (space)
        * how ?
        * discus the following:
          * line ?
          * square grid ?
          * hexagonal grid ?
          * other ?
    3. infrastructure
        1. **transportation** of people and goods
         * short distances
          * if spaced "close" together infrastructure may not be needed (everything within walking distance)
           * pros and cons with this setup ?
         * medium distances
          * if spaced at "medium" range (within a few miles/kilometers)
           * bicycles would be sufficient as only means of infrastructure
         * large distances
          * if spaced at "large" distances (over 10-20 miles/kilometers apart)
           * a vehicle (scooter/car/truck/bus) may be needed depending on the needs of the cluster / other clusters (neighbour communities)
           * eg. daily transport from north cluster through all middle clusters to south cluster - back and forth every 4 hours ?
        2. **communication**
         * distributed internet from central hub
          * central hexayurt has internet (satellite ?, baloon (Google project) ?, radio ?) and distributes internet to community through amplified WiFi ( http://hackaday.com/2016/01/05/ten-mile-raspberry-pi-wifi-with-a-catch/ http://www.engadget.com/2005/11/15/how-to-build-a-wifi-biquad-dish-antenna/ )
